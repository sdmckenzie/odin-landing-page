# Odin Project: Flexbox Landing Page

## Purpose

The purpose of this exercise is to gain experience creating a landing page from scratch. It will also serve as a way to give me exposure to working with git. In my case, I'll also use it as a project to practice using git to sync my work accross two computers: one a Windows 11 and the other a Linux machine.
